/*
* Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Follow up:

Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?


Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

public class RotateArrayWithK {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {

        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            int lastElement = nums[nums.length - 1];
            for (int j = nums.length-1; j >0; j--) {
                nums[j] = nums[j-1];
            }
            nums[0] = lastElement;
        }

    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new RotateArrayWithK().rotate(new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, 3);
    }
